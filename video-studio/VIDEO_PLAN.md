## Duration strategy

- **1:00 version**: High-impact mission reel. Keep all pillars but tighten each segment.
- **2:00 version**: Recommended default. Full value narrative with clear proof moments.
- **3:00 version**: Deep dive. Extend execution and copy-trading scenes for stronger conversion intent.

## Messaging priorities

Keep this order of importance in every cut:

1. Multi-asset capability (stock + crypto)
2. Fast execution and decision speed
3. Copy trading as practical strategy leverage
4. Trust, control, and reliability
5. Clear invitation to start

## Transition and animation language

- Scene transitions: fade, directional slide, and wipe to maintain momentum.
- In-scene animation:
  - Staggered narrative reveals to support story flow.
  - Metric card animations to reinforce value claims.
  - Dynamic market motion to communicate live opportunity.
- Keep camera movement minimal and deliberate (no aggressive zoom jitter).

## Capture order recommendation

1. Landing mission and market coverage moments.
2. Trade flow showing stock and crypto execution.
3. Copy trading strategy flow.
4. Trust and control scenes (wallet/profile).
5. Final mission recap and CTA.

This order minimizes re-navigation overhead and keeps motion continuity coherent in post.
