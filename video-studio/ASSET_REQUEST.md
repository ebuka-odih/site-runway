# Optional Assets Request

The video can render without external assets, but these files will improve final quality:

1. High-resolution RunwayAlgo logo lockup (transparent PNG or SVG)
2. 3 to 5 approved UI screenshots per key route:
   - `/`
   - `/#markets`
   - `/dashboard/home`
   - `/dashboard/trade`
   - `/dashboard/copy`
   - `/dashboard/wallet`
   - `/dashboard/profile`
3. Final CTA copy (exact wording) for end frame
4. Optional brand audio bed (WAV/MP3) and voiceover script

If you share these, place them under:

- `/Users/gnosis/Herd/runwayalgo/video-studio/assets`

Then we can wire them into the compositions for a polished production render.
